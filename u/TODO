    * u16x16 and u256x256 are trivially different; they should be
        merged and a larger set of directory structures supported
    * consolidate u/u256x256 into u/                                    * DONE
    * hash_test.go should use uI interface                              * DONE
    * consolidate u/u16x16 into u/                                      * DONE
   
    WHEN THE ABOVE IS STABLE:
    * UI.Exists should return (bool, error)
    * UI.GetPathForKey should return (string, error)

    AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION:
    * where rnglib is used to make random file names, use 
        io.ioutil.TempFile(dir, prefix string) (*os.File, error)

    * FIX: many functions (eg CopyAndPut) should return errors          * DONE
        but don't                                                       * DONE

    * CHANGE SHA1_LEN, SHA3_LEN so that, as elsewhere in xlattice_go,
        they are defined as 20 and 32 respectively; or change
        their names

    * some thought needs to be given to thread safety
