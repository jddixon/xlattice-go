    * Need binary key versions of 							            * DONE
        - Exists()							                            * DONE
        - FileLen()							                            * DONE
        - GetPathForKey()							                    * DONE
    * Need tests of
        - CopyAndPut()
        - GetData()
        - Put()
        - PutData()
        - Exists([]byte) or whatever the name is
        - FileLen([]byte)
        - GetPathForKey([]byte)

    * add at least DIR_FLAT implementation
    * merge sha1_test.go and sha3_test.go by adding a usingSHA1
        parameter in the right places
    * investigate and fix: comment says that GetData3 will only
        work for small files (same should apply to GetData1)

    * u16x16 and u256x256 are trivially different; they should be
        merged and a larger set of directory structures supported
   
    AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION:
    * where rnglib is used to make random file names, use 
        io.ioutil.TempFile(dir, prefix string) (*os.File, error)

2013-10-15
    * CHANGE SHA1_LEN, SHA3_LEN so that, as elsewhere in xlattice_go,
        they are defined as 20 and 32 respectively; or change
        their names

    * some thought needs to be given to thread safety
