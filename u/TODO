    * FIX: Stores organized DIR_FLAT are actually 16x16                 * DONE
    * the functions with similar names operating on []byte and
        string keys (Exists, KeyExists, etc) need better names
        that follow a regular pattern
        - need to transition to the new names, with older names
            available but clearly marked deprecated

    * Need DIRFLAT as well as DIR16x16 and DIR256x256                   * DONE
    * Code needs checking: carefully compare UFlat and U16x16 etc
        - eg hash != key test, which should use bytes.Equal()

    * Need binary key versions of 							            * DONE
        - Exists()							                            * DONE
        - FileLen()							                            * DONE
        - GetPathForKey()							                    * DONE
    * Need tests of
        - CopyAndPut()                                                  * DONE
        - GetData()
        - Put()
        - PutData()
        - KeyExists([]byte)                                             * DONE
        - FileLen([]byte)
        - GetPathForKey([]byte)

    * add at least DIR_FLAT implementation                              * DONE
    * merge sha1_test.go and sha3_test.go by adding a usingSHA1
        parameter in the right places
    * investigate and fix: comment says that GetData3 will only
        work for small files (same should apply to GetData1)

    * u16x16 and u256x256 are trivially different; they should be
        merged and a larger set of directory structures supported
   
    AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION:
    * where rnglib is used to make random file names, use 
        io.ioutil.TempFile(dir, prefix string) (*os.File, error)

2013-10-15
    * CHANGE SHA1_LEN, SHA3_LEN so that, as elsewhere in xlattice_go,
        they are defined as 20 and 32 respectively; or change
        their names

    * some thought needs to be given to thread safety
