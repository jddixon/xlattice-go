    * New should create top level directory structure with appropriate 	* DONE
        permissions, which means by default 0750 for U/, 0770 for 	    * DONE
        U/in, 0700 for U/tmp, and 0750 for U/x, where the x represents	* DONE
        the top level hex directories.	                                * DONE

    * add at least DIR_FLAT implementation
    * merge sha1_test.go and sha3_test.go by adding a usingSHA1
        parameter in the right places
    * investigate and fix: comment says that GetData3 will only
        work for small files (same should apply to GetData1)

    * u16x16 and u256x256 are trivially different; they should be
        merged and a larger set of directory structures supported
   
    WHEN THE ABOVE IS STABLE:
    * UI.Exists should return (bool, error)                             * DONE
    * UI.GetPathForKey should return (string, error)                    * DONE

    AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION:
    * where rnglib is used to make random file names, use 
        io.ioutil.TempFile(dir, prefix string) (*os.File, error)

2013-10-15
    * CHANGE SHA1_LEN, SHA3_LEN so that, as elsewhere in xlattice_go,
        they are defined as 20 and 32 respectively; or change
        their names

    * some thought needs to be given to thread safety
