    * msg/TODO: drop Hello from protocol

2013-12-10
    * protocol/aescnx seems wholly superfluous; drop?

2013-11-25  * FOCUS *
    * argument to rnglib.NextBytes should be []byte, not &[]byte

2013-11-08
    * xu.SameBytes() is functionally identical to Equal() from the
        bytes package, and so should be dropped

2013-10-25
    * move the project version number from rnglib/ to util/ or subdir
    * xlReg should drop version number from rng/const.go and use
        project version number instead
