    * protocol/aescnx seems wholly supersluous; drop?

2013-11-25
    * argument to rnglib.NextBytes should be []byte, not &[]byte

2013-11-08
    * xu.SameBytes() is functionally identical to Equal() from the
        bytes package, and so should be dropped

2013-10-25
    * move the project version number from rnglib/ to util/ or subdir
    * xlReg should drop version number from rng/const.go and use
        project version number instead
