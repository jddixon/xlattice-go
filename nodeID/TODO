    * idMapHAMT_perf_test.go line 71 unexpected nil value

    * idMapHAMT.Size() requires HAMT.GetDepth()
    * reconcile: HAMT.Find() returns a NotFound if the entry is not
        present; IDMapHAMT.Find() returns a nil value ANd a nil error
    * DEBUG: idMapHAMT_concur_test.go hangs                             * FIXED
        - possibly deadlocks, possibly just very very slow              * FIXED

    * when HAMT.GetLeafCount() works correctly,                         * DONE
        and when HAMT.GetDepth() is available,
        implement idMapHAMT.Size()

    * need a benchmark to get insertion time                            * DONE
        - the N values should be generated in a separate step, with     * DONE

    * need IDMap.Clear() for xd.MemCache
    * need IDMap.Delete(key *xi.NodeID) error, also for xd.MemCache

    * drop bni_map*.go*
    * clean up NodeID.Compare(); handling of err is uhm bizarre

    * need performance difference between n.Compare(other) and
        SameNodeID(a, b)
        - that is, we could use Compare() to implement SameNodeID(),
            if it's faster
