    * need a benchmark to get insertion time                            * DONE
        - the N values should be generated in a separate step, with     * DONE
            timing starting only after all values are available         * DONE
    * need a test which inserts say 64K nodes using say                 * DONE
        4,8,16,32,64 degrees of concurrency                             * DONE

    * test should preserve the resultant trees and collect statistics   * DONE
        should as maximum depth                                         * DONE
        - this requires appropriate functions to gather the stats       * DONE

    * need IDMap.Clear() for xd.MemCache
    * need IDMap.Delete(key *xi.NodeID) error, also for xd.MemCache

    * drop bni_map*.go*
    * clean up NodeID.Compare(); handling of err is uhm bizarre

    * need performance difference between n.Compare(other) and
        SameNodeID(a, b)
        - that is, we could use Compare() to implement SameNodeID(),
            if it's faster
