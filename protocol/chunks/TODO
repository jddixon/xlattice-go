    * Make a clear decision on whether and where to use big- and        * DONE
        little-endian data (search on LittleEndian)                     * DONE
        - we store chunk lengths big-endian                             * DONE

    * NewChunkList must have a filename or io.Reader parameter !!!

    * We need a message/file hash to build the ChunkList, so if the
        input parameter is an io.Reader, we will need to make two
        passes over the message, first to determine its length and
        content hash, and then to chunk it.
