    * rename MemCache.Add() to Insert()
        - should be same func names as IDMap except where 
            functionality actually differs

    * redesign code to not use callbacks

2014-01-11
    * need to review existing Java code to ensure that it can use
        xlattice_go/u
    * KeyQueue.FinishGet() may result in deadlock                       * SKIP!
