    * chunk(2).jpg, some items from yesterday
        - should be centered
        - change edge from doubled to single line
        - add a title ("chunk layout")
        - add a second row for field length ?
        - add another row for field content?
    * index.md needs to be fleshed out
        - each component should get a paragraph or two on 
            index.md
        - then each component gets a separate page:
            * util.md
            * rnglib.md - exists, badly linked to, may need edit
            * u.md - exists, but largely an API
            * crypto.md
            * transport.md
            * protocol.md
                - chunks.md exists, but probably should hang off
                    protocol.md
            * overlay.md
            * node.md
            * reg.md - para exists, but needs some cleanup
            * httpd.md

    * add another figure describing chunkList and digiList
    * point out that chunks need not be assembled into a file and
        that chunks may be distributed over a number of machines
        - reason for doing so?
