    * FIX: xlReg getting 'permission denied' when trying to reload
        existing mapping file

2013-10-18
    * add backingFile string parameter to NewBloomSHA3
        - alternatively this is NewMappedBloomSHA3
        - size is 2^m bytes = 2^(m-12) blocks
            * so m must be >= 12
        - if parameter is "", not memory-mapped
2013-10-15
    * this suggests a need for
        - func (b3 *BloomSHA3) Union(*BloomSHA3) error
        - where the obvious error is that m and k differ
        - this is presumably a merge in place
    * DROP THE ABOVE; memory-mapped filters serve the same purpose

2013-10-12
    * implement Bloom filter (xlattice_j/.../crypto/filters)            * DONE
      ...`
    * then look at Wikipedia article
    * and google on "golang bloom filter"

    * Supposedly RSA believes dual elliptic curve deterministic 
        random number generation algorithm contains a flaw 
        introduced by NSA and so has advised not using it 
        (BBC article today)
        - so review the code
        - do something to scramble the bits ?
