    * need filters:CountingBloom for xd.DiskCacahe
        - and test

2014-01-10
    * need builds/buildList.go ReadContents                             * DONE
    * need builds/buildList.go ParseBuildList                           * DONE
    * need builds/buildList_test.go                                     * DONE
    * FIX: signedList_test has no timestamps - but succeeds !           * SKIP
        - ah, but zero is a legitimate timestamp                        * SKIP

    * should be modified to use uint for index of list items:
        - SignedList                                                    * DONE
        - MockSignedList                                                * DONE
        - signedList_test.go                                            * DONE
        - BuildList                                                     * DONE
    * Modify SignedList so that the basic functionality is identical
        to that of MockSignedList
        - and then drop MockSignedList as redundant
    * buildList.go needs ParseBuildList, currently just a stub

2014-01-07
    * MockSignedList digSig should be base64-encoded, is just hex       * DONE
    * SignedList.String() does not CRLF-terminate lines

2014-01-06
    * ParseSignedList is marked 'subclasses must implement', but        * DONE
        it should at least in part be implemented by SignedList;        * DONE
        presumably we require subclass to provide a function which      * DONE
        parses a content line.                                          * DONE
    * signedList_test.go has stubs, need to complete                    * DONE

2014-01-04 
    * implement
        - signedListI.go for ../overlay/dataKeyed*.go                   * DONE
        - signedList.go, as an 'abstract class'                         * DONE
        - mock_signedList_test.go to exercise SignedList                * DONE
        - signedList_test.go, which uses MockSignedList                 * DONE

2013-10-12
    * implement Bloom filter (xlattice_j/.../crypto/filters)            * DONE
      ...`
    * then look at Wikipedia article
    * and google on "golang bloom filter"

    * Supposedly RSA believes dual elliptic curve deterministic 
        random number generation algorithm contains a flaw 
        introduced by NSA and so has advised not using it 
        (BBC article today)
        - so review the code
        - do something to scramble the bits ?
