    * MockSignedList digSig should be base64-encoded
    * SignedList.String() does not CRLF-terminate lines

2014-01-06
    * ParseSignedList is marked 'subclasses must implement', but
        it should at least in part be implemented by SignedList;
        presumably we require subclass to provide a function which
        parses a content line.

    * signedList_test.go has stubs, need to complete

2014-01-04 
    * implement
        - signedListI.go for ../overlay/dataKeyed*.go                   * DONE
        - signedList.go, as an 'abstract class'
        - mock_signedList_test.go to exercise SignedList
        - signedList_test.go, which uses MockSignedList

    * implement Bloom filter (xlattice_j/.../crypto/filters)            * DONE
      ...`
    * then look at Wikipedia article
    * and google on "golang bloom filter"

    * Supposedly RSA believes dual elliptic curve deterministic 
        random number generation algorithm contains a flaw 
        introduced by NSA and so has advised not using it 
        (BBC article today)
        - so review the code
        - do something to scramble the bits ?
