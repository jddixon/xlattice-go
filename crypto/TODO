    * ParseSignedList is marked 'subclasses must implement', but
        it should at least in part be implemented by SignedList;
        presumably we require subclass to provide a function which
        parses a content line.

    * implement
        - signedListI.go for ../overlay/dataKeyed*.go                   * DONE
        - signedList.go, as an 'abstract class'
        - mock_signedList_test.go to exercise SignedList
        - signedList_test.go, which uses MockSignedList

    * FIX: xlReg getting 'permission denied' when trying to reload      * DONE
        existing mapping file                                           * DONE

    * add backingFile string parameter to NewBloomSHA3				    * DONE
        - alternatively this is NewMappedBloomSHA3				        * DONE
        - size is 2^m bytes = 2^(m-12) blocks				            * DONE
            * so m must be >= 12				                        * DONE
        - if parameter is "", not memory-mapped				            * DONE

    * this suggests a need for			                                * SKIP
        - func (b3 *BloomSHA3) Union(*BloomSHA3) error			        * SKIP
        - where the obvious error is that m and k differ			    * SKIP
        - this is presumably a merge in place			                * SKIP
    * DROP THE ABOVE; memory-mapped filters serve the same purpose      * DONE

2013-10-12
    * implement Bloom filter (xlattice_j/.../crypto/filters)            * DONE
      ...`
    * then look at Wikipedia article
    * and google on "golang bloom filter"

    * Supposedly RSA believes dual elliptic curve deterministic 
        random number generation algorithm contains a flaw 
        introduced by NSA and so has advised not using it 
        (BBC article today)
        - so review the code
        - do something to scramble the bits ?
