    * implement MockConnection to simplify testing elsewhere

2013-08-27
    * the pseudo-constant ANY_TCP_END_POINT is a really bad		        * SKIP
        idea; get rid of it		                                        * SKIP
        - allow TcpConnector.Connect() to take a nil arg		        * SKIP
            instead		                                                * SKIP
    * see tests in msg/ : closing a connection does not change
        its state to DISCONNECTED!
        - BUT this is at the other end of the connection, and
            transport/tcp_connection.GetState() does not 
            examine the state of the underlying connection

    * If a :0 endPoint is given to a TcpAcceptor, it should             * DONE
        be assigned a different port by the operating system.		    * DONE
        However, NewTcpAcceptor will save the :0 endPoint and		    * DONE
        never change it.  Modify it to correct the port number.		    * DONE

    * TcpConnection.{Read,Write}() should test the connection's
        state
    * TcpConnection.Get{Near,Far}End returns FarEnd and NearEnd
        respectively
    * tcp_server_test succeeds if K=16, N=32 but hangs if N=64

2013-07-19
    * Various tcp*.go should rely upon an ip_address abstraction;
        an IPv4 address is OK for now.
